title: About Me

<p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my blog.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I've been a bit of a career nomad. From 2011-2014, I camped out at Amazon's fashion start-up MyHabit as a Buyer and ad-hoc tool-builder. More recently, I worked on several web development projects at Razorfish as a Functional Analyst.</p>

<p>These experiences were wildly educational for me and opened my eyes to the start-up vibe, e-commerce, agency life, agile, and much more. Most of all, working alongside brilliantly smart humans showed me what passion can look like. These work experiences were fulfilling for me, but there was something lacking.</p>

<p>It hit me like a ton of bricks that all the while I was contributing to project teams: brainstorming, iterating, coordinating, documenting... what I really wanted to be doing was BUILDING. Which brought me to The Flatiron School. And here I am.</p>
